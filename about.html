    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Howdy! I'm Sydney Wilson, a third year undergraduate Software Engineering student at RIT. I am currently on co-op with GCCIS Tech-Ops, and am doing work in web development. Specifically, I am working on data management, UI/UX, and increasing the overall adaptability and extendibility of the product. The purpose of this portfolio is to exemplify my skills, through projects I have created. Happy Scrolling!</p>
